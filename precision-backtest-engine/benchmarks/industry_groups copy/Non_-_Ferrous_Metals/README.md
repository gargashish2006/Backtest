## Methodology

### Constituent Selection (Point-in-Time)
At each quarterly rebalancing date:
1. Identify all stocks classified in **Non - Ferrous Metals** industry group
2. Filter stocks that:
   - Had at least 90 days of trading history
   - Were actively trading (price within 30 days)
   - Existed at that point in time (no look-ahead bias)

### Return Calculation
- **Equal-weighted**: Each constituent has equal weight regardless of market cap
- **Rebalancing**: Quarterly (quarter-end dates)
- **Return Period**: Holding period from one quarter-end to next

### No Survivorship Bias
- Only includes stocks that actually existed at each rebalancing date
- Delisted stocks are included up to their delisting date
- New listings enter after meeting minimum history requirement
